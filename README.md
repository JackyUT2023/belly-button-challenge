# belly-button-challenge
This is My Boot Camp Module 14 Challenge.

## Background
In this challenge, an interactive dashboard is built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Materials
As starter materials, there are index.html, samples.json, and the static folder included in the StarterCode folder and they are used throughout the work.

## Parts
There are 4 parts for the projects:
    - Build the dropdown menu in the Test Subject ID section;
    - Popup the Demographic Info
    - Create the Barchart
    - Create the bubblechart
